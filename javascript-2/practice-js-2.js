    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does.

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.

/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

const gitHubDefinition = 'a website that holds and saves coding projects for people'

//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 9////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
